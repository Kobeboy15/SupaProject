# SupaProject (SupaPass Project)
Tasked with the building of a small prototype todo list manager, using React, with the implementation of a barebones [GraphQL Api](https://supado.herokuapp.com/console/).

## Key Features:
- See a list of all todos â€“ separated into two sections: Todo and Completed.
- Create a new todo.
- Mark an existing todo as complete.
- Modify the title of an existing todo.
- Delete an existing todo.
- Have a sufficient amount of styling to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
- Respect user accessibility with regards to any button labels, colours, keyboard navigation, etc.

### Optional Features

- Use Tailwind CSS to style the app.
- Make the web app fully responsive across multiple breakpoints.
- Use Typescript.
- Allow the user to set a priority or set a custom order for their todos. (Wasn't able to implement)
- 'Soft delete' tasks, allowing the user to navigate to a 'Recently deleted' page and restore them.
